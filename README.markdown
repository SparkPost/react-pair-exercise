# React Pair Coding Exercise

This is a pair coding exercise used by SparkPost for hiring.  The goal is to read through, implement, and test the following user stories.  The exercise is timeboxed at one hour.  Not all of the stories need to be completed.  Please focus more on understanding the problem and thinking through the solution rather than rushing.
